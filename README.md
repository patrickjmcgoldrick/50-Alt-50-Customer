## Quote
“Conscious consumption is a mass movement” - Nick Green from thrive

## SDG #3 Heath
My background is in healthcare and farming. Our main sustainable development goal is to promote good health and well-being through healthy locally sourced produce. 

## Food Deserts - Access to quality produce
To clarify, we aim to serve both the individual consumer as well as businesses. We hope that this project will support efforts that 50alt50 is making to deliver fresh produce to food deserts, which are urban areas where it is challenging to access affordable quality produce.    


## Quality of Food
Do you know where your food comes from? 

## Distance traveled
Produce on average travels 1500 miles and spends half its shelf life in transit just to get to your local supermarket. 

## Impacts
What is in your food? Sodium benzoate, sulfur dioxide, Propylparaben? All of these are preservatives. Some of these even NEGATIVELY impact health.


## Example using App, for an Individual
What if you wanted a cantaloupe? (*pull up app) Can we coordinate with a farmer near you to pick you a cantaloupe fresh from their field? 

	-Here, Rick Lattin is selling cantaloupe. The cantaloupe only has to travel 15 miles and will be delivered tomorrow. 

## Example Restaurant
Another example would be a restaurant placing orders to fulfill their customers daily consumption. 50alt50 allows any establishment to serve farm fresh produce.    

## Bridge
50alt50 bridges the gap between the local farmer and consumers. We created an online platform where farmers can market and sell their produce. Vetted couriers are then notified and paid to pick up the produce from the farm and deliver it directly to the consumer.

   
## Personal Story
I’VE PILOTED THIS IDEA IN NORTHERN NEVADA WHERE MY FAMILY’S FARM IS, and we already have LOI from 5 casinos resorts and several restaurants. 

## Three Pillars
The platform has 3 arms, the online market where farmers list produce and consumers can make purchases, the order fulfillment where farmers receive orders and prepare the produce, and then the delivery platform where drivers access available deliveries and receive payment. 

## Expanding
Going forward we would like to expand to California, especially the Greater Los Angeles Area. 

## Ask
I would like to see a commitment of $5000 today in order to further develop 50alt50’s market platform.
